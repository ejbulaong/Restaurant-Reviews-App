# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

As more and more users are interacting with apps on their mobile device, there is a growing need to have applications that work offline, when users donâ€™t have a connection. In this project, I learned the basics creating an offline first app, using Service Workers to store and retrieve images, JavaScript, CSS and HTML using the browsers offline storage. Along with this, I created an application that will interact with 3rd party services, and convert an existing online application so that it will work offline..
